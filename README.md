# CSC630 Unit Testing Starter Code

Check out versions for Java or Python. Both files start out using `input`/`Scanner`, and are frustrating to test. It's much better (and more welcoming to other open source developers!) to use test code.

### Java

For the java version, you'll need to have [JUnit and Hamcrest as dependencies](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install).

### Javascript

For the javascript version, you'll need to install jest as dependency, according to [this guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started).
